1. Persona/Scenario

The persona should include a description of a prototypical, target user and includes discussion of their interests and responsibilities (e.g., their job description if a professional/scientist; their motivation if part of the general public), with a specific focus on their key needs, expertise levels (across domains and technologies), and motivation. Your description of needs should connect directly to lecture discussion of goals, objectives, operands, and insights: in other words, describe their overarching goals, their primary tasks (objectives+operands), and key insights. You do not need to support all potential goals/tasks/insights, but make clear in your discussion which you believe you need to emphasize in your conceptual design.

The scenario then walks us through a hypothetical interaction session with your proposed interactive map, working through multiple stages of interaction loops. As you describe your scenario, relate the proposed functionality (representation designs and interaction operators) to user objectives using terminology from lecture. Your persona and scenario combined are limited to 1-page, single-spaced in the draft (although may grow beyond this in the final submission given discussion).
