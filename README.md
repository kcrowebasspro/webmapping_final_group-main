1. Persona/Scenario

The audience I'm targeting are potential home buyers in the state of North Carolina. Homeowner's insurance premiums are rising quickly and taking up increasinly larger portions of households' monthly payments. When shopping for a new home, a buyer will want to know if that home is in an area where rates have increased significantly. 

The scenario of use is a potential buyer coming to the site to check the information on average premiums, how often homes in the area made claims against their insurance, and how much insurance companies lost in each ZIP code relative to the premiums paid. 

On load, the page will have the average premiums for 2022. There will be text laying out what the users can see on the map, definition of the variables, and suggestions for searching the map and interpreting results.
